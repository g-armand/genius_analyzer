This project aims to gather all lyrics from artists from genius' website.
This is a student project whose only aims are to gather experience, no commercial uses are intended here.

Since, genius(a website that references song's lyrics) let you use their API for gathering informations about artists, other ways are used to gather lyrics.

as written in the following quote from genius's terms of use(https://genius.com/static/terms), it is prohibited to use genius' content for commercial reasons:

"""Commercial Use: Unless otherwise expressly authorized herein or by Genius' express written consent, you agree not to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sell, resell, exploit, transfer or transmit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service. The Service is for your personal use and may not be used for direct commercial endeavors without the express written consent of Genius."""

If you decide to use the code from this repository for projects that go against genius' terms of use, you take the entire responsibility regarding the consequences you might face.
This is a student NLP project, I do it because I want to improve my skills, if you want to use this code following a philosophy that go against the one stated above: code your own it's basic shit.


Now...

As you have understood, this project uses genius' API(especially for retrieving songs' names of any artist).
So you'll need to create an account on genius.com to generate your token, and to store it in a "api_key.py" file, this file has to be in the same directory as main.py

get through the code and reverse engineer it, everything is explained as best as possible, since the project is still in development phasis...
